# machinelearning

A collection of machine learning notebooks and deep learning models.

**Table of Contents**

**self-driving-car** -- (in progress) my current neural network to steer a self driving car. currently makes it a quarter around the track before diving into the water.

## models
1. **cat-image-recognition** -- a neural network that recognizes cat pictures from non cat pictures
2. **mnist-numbers** -- a neural network that classifies handwritten digits
3. **traffic-signs** -- a neural network that classifies and recognizes traffic signs

## other-labs
1. **cnn-setup** -- sets up the fundamental functions and building blocks that are required of CNNs (convolution, forward pass, forward and backward pooling, etc)
1. **comparing-initializations** -- a comparison of zero, random, and He initialization of parameters
2. **comparing-optimizations** -- a comparison of batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and mini-batch gradient descent
3. **comparing-regularization** -- a comparison of L2 regularization, dropout, and no regularization
4. **deep-neural-network-setup** -- sets up the fundamental functions and processes that are required of neural networks (forward propagation, backward propagation, initializing parameters, etc)
5. **gradient-check** -- implementing the process of gradient check to ensure back propagation works effectively
6. **linear-regression** -- a simple implementation of linear regression, and my first introduction to machine learning
7. **tensorflow** -- an introduction to tensorflow and its usage of variables, constants, and sessions (essentially a tensorflow tutorial)
