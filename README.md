# machinelearning

A collection of machine learning and deep learning models.

Table of Contents
1. **deep-neural-network-setup** -- sets up the fundamental functions and processes that are required of neural networks (forward propagation, backward propagation, initializing parameters, etc).
2. **linear-regression** -- a simple implementation of linear regression, and first introduction to machine learning
3. **mnist-numbers** -- a neural network that classifies handwritten digits
4. **self-driving-car** -- (in progress) my current neural network to steer a self driving car
5. **traffic-signs** -- a neural network that classifies and recognizes traffic signs
6. **cat-image-recognition** -- a neural network that recognizes cat pictures from non cat pictures
7. **comparing-initializations** -- a comparison of zero, random, and He initialization of parameters
